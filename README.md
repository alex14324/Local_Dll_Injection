Overview

DLL injection is a method used to run custom code within the address space of another process. This project demonstrates a straightforward approach to inject a DLL using Windows API functions.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Windows operating system
    Visual Studio or any C++ compiler
    Basic understanding of C++ and Windows API

Installation

    Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/alex14324/Local_Dll_Injection.git
cd Local-Dll-Injection

    Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.

    Build the project to create the executable.

Usage

    Compile the DLL: Write your custom code in a DLL. Ensure the DLL is ready and available on your filesystem.

    Compile the Injector: Compile the injector program included in this repository.

    Run the Injector:
        Execute the injector with the target process name and the path to your DLL.

injector.exe target.exe "C:\path\to\your.dll"

    Observe the Results: Your DLL code will now execute within the context of the target process.

Code Explanation
Key Functions

    GetProcessId: Retrieves the process ID of the target application.
    InjectDLL: Handles the allocation of memory in the target process and executes the DLL.

Example Code

Hereâ€™s a snippet of the injection logic:

DWORD GetProcessId(const char* processName) {
    // Implementation to get process ID
}

void InjectDLL(DWORD processId, const char* dllPath) {
    // Implementation for DLL injection
}

Important Notes

    Ethics and Legality: Use this technique responsibly and only on processes you have permission to modify.
    Security Risks: DLL injection can pose security risks and may be flagged by antivirus software.
    Testing Environment: Always test in a controlled environment to avoid system instability.
